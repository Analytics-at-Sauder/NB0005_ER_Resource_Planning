    "In this notebook, we are going to explore ways that one can apply Discrete Event Simulation when making decisions for hospital resource planning. The notebook is divided into multiple scenarios, each incorporating more uncertainties than the previous one. We encourage you to create your own Jupytor notebook and follow along. **If you do not have Python or Jupyter Notebook installed yet, you could also experiment with the virtual notebook by clicking \"Launch Virtual Machine\" (powered by Binder) above.** On the other hand, the dowloadable Jupyter Notebook can be found [here]().\n",

    "Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is a useful decision making tool that can be applied to situations where resources are limited and queues exists in the process or system. Using DES, stakeholders can assess the outcomes, measured by specified Key Point Indicators (KPIs), of various scenarios (e.g. different bed capacities or staffing schedules in a clinic) without having to conduct experiments onsite (read more about DES itself [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/discrete-event-simulation)). Nowadays, there are many softwares that enable not only simulations but also animations of systems and processes. However, in this notebook, we will take a look at a process-based discrete event simulation framework within Python called SimPy. Through this notebook, we hope to give you some basic ideas of what some of the software packages are doing behind the scene.\n",
